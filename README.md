# JavaScript 30 Days Challenge

## Day 1

### Task 1: Declare Variable using `var` to a number
- **Description**: A variable is declared using `var` and assigned a numeric value. Its type is logged as `number`.

### Task 2: Declare Variable using `let` to a string
- **Description**: A variable is declared using `let` and assigned a string value. Its type is logged as `string`.

### Task 3: Declare Variable using `const` to a boolean
- **Description**: A variable is declared using `const` and assigned a boolean value. Its type is logged as `boolean`.

### Task 4: `typeof` operator
- **Description**: The `typeof` operator is used to log the type of a variable.

### Task 5: Reassigning `let`
- **Description**: A variable declared with `let` is initially assigned a numeric value and then reassigned to a string value. Both values are logged.

### Task 6: Reassigning `const`
- **Description**: Attempting to reassign a variable declared with `const` results in an error. This demonstrates that `const` variables cannot be reassigned.

### Feature Request #1: Display variables in a table
- **Description**: An array of objects is created to store variables and their types. This array is then displayed in a table format using `console.table` for better visualization.

### Feature Request #2: Demonstrate `let` and `const`
- **Description**: A variable declared with `let` is incremented and its new value is logged. An attempt to reassign a `const` variable demonstrates that it results in an error. The updated variables are again displayed in a table format using `console.table`.
