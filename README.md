# JavaScript 30 Days Challenge

## Day 1

### Task 1: Declare Variable using `var` to a number
- **Description**: A variable is declared using `var` and assigned a numeric value. Its type is logged as `number`.

### Task 2: Declare Variable using `let` to a string
- **Description**: A variable is declared using `let` and assigned a string value. Its type is logged as `string`.

### Task 3: Declare Variable using `const` to a boolean
- **Description**: A variable is declared using `const` and assigned a boolean value. Its type is logged as `boolean`.

### Task 4: `typeof` operator
- **Description**: The `typeof` operator is used to log the type of a variable.

### Task 5: Reassigning `let`
- **Description**: A variable declared with `let` is initially assigned a numeric value and then reassigned to a string value. Both values are logged.

### Task 6: Reassigning `const`
- **Description**: Attempting to reassign a variable declared with `const` results in an error. This demonstrates that `const` variables cannot be reassigned.

### Feature Request #1: Display variables in a table
- **Description**: An array of objects is created to store variables and their types. This array is then displayed in a table format using `console.table` for better visualization.

### Feature Request #2: Demonstrate `let` and `const`
- **Description**: A variable declared with `let` is incremented and its new value is logged. An attempt to reassign a `const` variable demonstrates that it results in an error. The updated variables are again displayed in a table format using `console.table`.


## Day 2

### Task 1: Add two numbers
- **Description**: Add two variables and log the result.

### Task 2: Subtract two numbers
- **Description**: Subtract one variable from another and log the result.

### Task 3: Multiply two numbers
- **Description**: Multiply two variables and log the result.

### Task 4: Divide two numbers
- **Description**: Divide one variable by another and log the result. Also, log the type of the result.

### Task 5: Remainder of two numbers
- **Description**: Calculate the remainder when one variable is divided by another and log it.

### Task 6: Use of +=
- **Description**: Increment a variable using `+=` and log the result.

### Task 7: Use of -=
- **Description**: Decrement a variable using `-=` and log the result.

### Task 8: Use of > and <
- **Description**: Compare two variables using `>` and `<` operators. Log the larger variable.

### Task 9: Use of >= and <=
- **Description**: Compare two variables using `>=` and `<=` operators. Log the smaller variable after an operation.

### Task 10: Use of == and ===
- **Description**: Compare two variables using `==` and `===` operators to check for equality.

### Task 11: Use of &&
- **Description**: Use the logical `&&` operator to evaluate multiple conditions.

### Task 12: Use of ||
- **Description**: Use the logical `||` operator to evaluate multiple conditions.

### Task 13: Use of !
- **Description**: Use the logical `!` operator to negate a boolean value based on a condition.

### Task 14: Use of Ternary Operator
- **Description**: Use the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative.

### Feature Request 1: Basic arithmetic operations
- **Description**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations on two additional variables. Log the results.

### Feature Request 2: Comparison operations
- **Description**: Compare two variables using various operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `&&`, `||`). Log the results.

### Feature Request 3: Use of Ternary Operator with a new variable
- **Description**: Use the ternary operator to determine if a variable is positive or negative and log the result.
