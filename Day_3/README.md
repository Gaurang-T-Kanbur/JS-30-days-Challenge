# JavaScript 30 Days Challenge

## Day 3

### Task 1: Positive or Negative Number
- **Description**: Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero using conditional statements.
- **Concepts and Methodologies**: Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`).
- **Notes for Revision**: Use conditional statements to control program flow based on numeric conditions.

### Task 2: Right to Vote
- **Description**: Determine if a person is eligible to vote based on their age using conditional statements.
- **Concepts and Methodologies**: Conditional statements (`if`).
- **Notes for Revision**: Conditional logic helps determine eligibility based on specific criteria.

### Task 3: Largest of Three Numbers
- **Description**: Find the largest number among three given numbers using conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`).
- **Concepts and Methodologies**: Nested conditional statements.
- **Notes for Revision**: Nesting conditionals allows for hierarchical checks to find the maximum value.

### Task 4: Days using switch case
- **Description**: Display the name of the day based on a given day number using a `switch` statement.
- **Concepts and Methodologies**: Switch statement.
- **Notes for Revision**: Switch statements offer a concise way to execute different actions based on different conditions.

### Task 5: Grades using switch case
- **Description**: Determine a grade based on given marks using a `switch` statement with ranges.
- **Concepts and Methodologies**: Switch statement with range comparison.
- **Notes for Revision**: Switch statements can handle multiple conditions efficiently, especially for range-based evaluations.

### Task 6: Ternary Operator for Even or Odd
- **Description**: Use the ternary operator to determine if a number is even or odd.
- **Concepts and Methodologies**: Ternary operator.
- **Notes for Revision**: Ternary operators provide a concise way to write conditional expressions with clear true/false outcomes.

### Task 7: Leap Year
- **Description**: Determine if a given year is a leap year using conditional statements (`if`, `else`).
- **Concepts and Methodologies**: Conditional statements with logical operators.
- **Notes for Revision**: Logical operators (`&&`, `||`) combined with conditionals are essential for complex conditional checks.

### Feature Request 1: Positive or Negative Number (Additional)
- **Description**: Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero using conditional statements.
- **Concepts and Methodologies**: Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`).
- **Notes for Revision**: Practice using conditionals for various numeric checks and edge cases.

### Feature Request 2: Right to Vote (Additional)
- **Description**: Determine if a person is eligible to vote based on their age using conditional statements.
- **Concepts and Methodologies**: Conditional statements (`if`).
- **Notes for Revision**: Understand how conditional checks can be tailored to specific eligibility criteria.

### Feature Request 3: Days using switch case (Additional)
- **Description**: Display the name of the day based on a given day number using a `switch` statement.
- **Concepts and Methodologies**: Switch statement.
- **Notes for Revision**: Master switch statements to efficiently handle multiple conditional cases based on a single variable.

### Feature Request 4: Grades using switch case (Additional)
- **Description**: Determine a grade based on given marks using a `switch` statement with ranges.
- **Concepts and Methodologies**: Switch statement with range comparison.
- **Notes for Revision**: Learn to implement switch statements for grading systems, adapting to different score ranges.

### Feature Request 5: Leap Year (Additional)
- **Description**: Determine if a given year is a leap year using conditional statements (`if`, `else`).
- **Concepts and Methodologies**: Conditional statements with logical operators.
- **Notes for Revision**: Review how logical operators and conditionals interact to verify leap year conditions accurately.
