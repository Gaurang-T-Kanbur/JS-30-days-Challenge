- **Concepts and Methodologies**: Method to update object properties.

#### Task 5: Nested Object
- **Description**: Create a nested object representing a library with an array of books.
- **Concepts and Methodologies**: Nested objects, Arrays of objects.

#### Task 6: Iterate Over Nested Objects
- **Description**: Use array methods to iterate over the book titles in the library object.

#### Task 7: Use `this` Keyword in Methods
- **Description**: Add a method to the book object using the `this` keyword to refer to the objectâ€™s properties.
- **Concepts and Methodologies**: Using `this` keyword, Method definition.

#### Task 8: Iterate Over Object Properties
- **Description**: Use a `for...in` loop to iterate over all properties of the book object and differentiate between methods and other properties.
- **Concepts and Methodologies**: `for...in` loop, Differentiating between methods and properties.

#### Task 9: Use of `Object.keys` and `Object.values`
- **Description**: Retrieve and display the keys and values of the book object using `Object.keys` and `Object.values`.
- **Concepts and Methodologies**: `Object.keys`, `Object.values`, Accessing object properties dynamically.
